I was running my test from my three sorting algorithms it took approx. 11 seconds and 852 ms to run  Quicksort is written so the numbers will sort each other from high to l
ow no matter the numbers are input. Selection sort is coded so if you run put the items from highest to lowest 
or a random order, as you in put the numbers the code with automatically push the number 
thats higher to the right and continue moving forward. Mergesort is coded, the way we did in class so you 
will have a mid point and the numbers will move based on teh mid point number of the set of integers you are using 
and move accordingly.
