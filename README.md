Quick Sort Run time- Uses the O(n log n) because it shows the progression of the constant 
sorting of the integers, like a graph as it slowly starts to move up.

Selection Sort Run time- O(n^2) the integers will slowly start to slope up as the test harness 
begin running through the integers

Merge Sort Run Time - O(n log n)  because as the midpoint and starts to change and replace the 
heads and tails then the integers will continually move up.
