As I was copying the code over, I had alot of red lines appear for some odd reason, especially for the selection sort search algorithm. 
I understood it and followed along in class but it almost seems impossible for me to fix. 
I was looking over teh test harness stuff and I did not know exactly where to put it into the code, if it was udner the test directory or the code itself. 
I did use the test directory to run my code.
