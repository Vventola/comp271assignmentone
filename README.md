As I was copying the code over, I had alot of red lines appear for some odd reason, especially for the selection sort search algorithm. 
I understood it and followed along in class but it almost seems impossible for me to fix. 
I was looking over teh test harness stuff and I did not know exactly where to put it into the code, if it was udner the test directory or the code itself. 
I did use the test directory to run my code. I was able to read the terminal window and understand everything that was there.
At my current status which is a struggle, I complied 22 errors, with the first one starting off at Line7 for an illegal start of an expression. it managed to be able to be able to run in 4 seconds and 29 ms. Some of the error issues I was recieving though I did not entirely understand, 
like at line 44 "numbers[indexOfSmallest] = temp; I recieved two expected errrors one pertaining to the brackets and the semi colon but they are clearly there in the code and they are needed for the array and since it was the final argument I used the semi colon.
