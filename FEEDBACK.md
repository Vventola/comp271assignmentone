* Code does not compile for many reasons, -30 points
* Test harness does not run.  I don't see any test here, actually, but nothing 
  can run if it doesn't compile, -15 points
* Your summaries and explanations in the README do not cover what the assignment 
  asked for!  Read the assignment more carefully, it is asking you to describe the
  runtime profile of each algorithm
  * No analysis of Selection Sort: -5 points
  * No analysis of Quick Sort: -5 points
  * No analysis of Merge Sort: -5 points

To help you understand what is wrong with your code, I have copied some code from
`AssignmentOne.java` and pasted it into a new class called `MergeSort`, in a new file called
`MergeSort.java`.  I have written a comment in that new class explaining what was wrong with it, 
as an example for you to follow if you want to increase your score.  You may do this anytime until the end
of the class term, and I will reevaluate and add points as it improves.

I suggest you follow this example and decompose what is currently in `AssignmentOne.java`
into multiple files, with one class per file, as Java requires!

* Code compiles!!  Good job!! 
  * Fixed all compilation errors: +30 points
  
* Analysis of the sorting algorithms is pretty good.  Not as thorough as it could be, 
  but you're clearly understanding the concepts.
  * Improved analysis of the sorting algorithms: +10 points
